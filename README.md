# **Tanzania Water Well Condition Prediction**
## **Project Overview**
Tanzania, a developing country with a population of over 57 million, faces challenges in providing clean water to its citizens. While thousands of water wells exist, many are **non-functional** or require **urgent repairs**. This project aims to **predict the condition of a water well** based on key factors such as **pump type, installation year, and geographic location**.

By building a **machine learning classifier**, we can help NGOs and government agencies **prioritize well repairs, allocate resources efficiently, and plan for better water infrastructure**.

---
## **Problem Statement**
The dataset contains records of water points across Tanzania, including their operational status. The goal is to classify each well into one of three categories:
- **Functional** â€“ The well is fully operational.
- **Functional but needs repair** â€“ The well is working but requires maintenance.
- **Non-functional** â€“ The well is broken and needs full replacement.

---
## **Dataset Description**
The dataset includes various features that influence a well's condition, such as:
- **Geographical Data:** Region, district, latitude, and longitude.
- **Well Characteristics:** Pump type, extraction type, water source, and management type.
- **Operational History:** Installation year, recorded usage, and payment method.

## **Data Preparation & Preprocessing**
To ensure a high-quality model, the following preprocessing steps were performed:
**Handling Missing Values** â€“ Imputing missing data using median (for numerical features) and most frequent (for categorical features).  
**Feature Engineering** â€“ Extracting useful information, such as the installation year difference.  
**Encoding Categorical Variables** â€“ Using **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical variables.  
**Scaling Numerical Features** â€“ Using **StandardScaler** for normalization.  
**Train-Test Split** â€“ Separating the dataset into **training (80%) and testing (20%)** datasets.    

---
## **Modeling Approach**
We trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models to find the best classifier for predicting well conditions:
1. **Decision Tree Classifier** â€“ Baseline model for interpretability.
2. **Random Forest Classifier** â€“ Improved performance with feature importance analysis.
3. **LightXGM Boost Classifier** â€“ Tuned model for higher accuracy and robustness.

### **Hyperparameter Tuning**
Hyperparameters were optimized using  **RandomizedSearchCV** to improve model performance.

---
## **Model Evaluation**
The models were evaluated using:
- **Accuracy Score** â€“ Measures overall correctness.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score** â€“ Provides insight into model effectiveness, especially for imbalanced data.
- **Confusion Matrix** â€“ Shows classification performance.
- **ROC-AUC Score** â€“ Evaluates classification thresholds.

### **Best Performing Model:**
**Random Forest Classifier** achieved the highest accuracy and best-balanced performance.  
**Feature Importance Analysis** showed that **extraction type, installation year, and management type** were the most significant factors influencing well conditions.

---
## **Results & Insights**
 **Most non-functional wells are older installations, indicating the need for better maintenance planning.**  
 **Certain pump types are more prone to failure, which can guide procurement decisions.**  
 **Regions with frequent failures should be prioritized for intervention and funding.**  

### **Limitations:**
 **Some features may have data quality issues** (e.g., missing installation years).  
 **Possible bias in data collection** (e.g., over-representation of certain regions).  
 **Additional real-time data could improve predictions** (e.g., weather conditions, community feedback).

## **Future Improvements**
 **Integrate deep learning models (Neural Networks).**  
 **Deploy as a web-based dashboard for real-time predictions.**  
 **Incorporate external data sources for richer insights.**  

---
## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how **machine learning** can help **optimize water resource management in Tanzania**. By predicting **well conditions**, stakeholders can take **proactive actions** to ensure reliable water access for millions of people.

 **NGOs** can use this model to identify wells that need repairs urgently.  
 **The Tanzanian government** can leverage insights to improve well planning.  
 **Communities** can benefit from better-maintained water sources.  
 **Let's use AI for social good!** ðŸ’§ðŸš€
